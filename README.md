# How to download korean mods from Arcalive
To respect the Korean community I won't share any arcalive links, passwords and mods itself.
This guide is made to help you get mods **yourself**. Koreans don't mind you downloading their mods as
long as you do it quietly and don't spam everywhere things like "password pls" and etc.

You don't have to register unless you want NSFW mods.

- Top Search Bar: you can find many groups for different games and stuff (basically it's korean Reddit lol)  
As for gacha games modding there are two main groups:
  - **미호요스킨모드 채널** - Genshin, HSR, ZZZ
  - **명조 모딩 채널** - Wuwa
- Bottom Search Bar: you can find posts and mods. There you can enter korean names of characters.  
  Characters' names in korean:
  - Genshin: https://genshin-builds.com/ko/characters
  - HSR: https://genshin-builds.com/ko/hsr
  - ZZZ: https://genshin-builds.com/ko/zenless
